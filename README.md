# todo-web-app

The todo-web-app (have not picked a name for the websites name) is a webapp inspired by [Treollo.com](https://trello.com/en)

This web app is a practice projcect created using Node.js and Handlebars. This is my personal project and not a school assignment. This project is also used for me to practice the correct GitHub workflow.

This project is not complete and still ongoing, therefore please do not use your real information such as real emails or passwords in the web app.

## Note

This website is not yet hosted. It will be hosted for free on [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) as it is only a project/demo of my knowledge. Maybe one day it will become more than a demo.

The website will be hosted on [Heroku.com](https://www.heroku.com/) around the 30th of May as Heroku has disabled github deployment integration while they are working on a breach.

## Features

This web app will allow the users to:
- log in
- create lists
- add content to the lists
- delete lists
- edit lists

Lists will be persistent and only lists created by the user will be displayed.

In the future I want to implement the use of Firebase database instead of storing information in a JSON file.
